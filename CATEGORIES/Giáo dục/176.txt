học tiếng clinton nêu trump tổng_thống     trump vs clinton well like everyone else i ve_spent a lot of time thinking over the last hours about what we heard and saw you know with prior republican nominees for president i disagreed with them on politics policies principles but i never questioned their fitness to serve donald trump is different i said starting back in june that he was not fit to be president and commander in chief and many republicans and independents have said the same thing what we all saw and heard on friday was donald talking about women what he thinks about women what he does to women and he has said that the video doesn t represent who he is but i think it s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is because we have seen this throughout the campaign we have seen him insult women we have seen him rate women on their appearance ranking them from one to ten we ve_seen him embarrass women on tv and on twitter we saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former miss universe in the harshest most personal terms yes this is who donald trump is but it s not only women and it s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president because he has also targeted immigrants african americans latinos people with disabilities pows muslims and many others this is who donald trump is and the question for us the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are that s why to go back to your question i want to send a message we all should to every boy and girl and indeed to the entire world that america already is great but we are great because we are good and we will respect one another and we will work with one another and we will celebrate our diversity these are very important values to me because this is the america that i know and love and i can pledge to you tonight that this is the america that i will serve if i m fortunate enough to become your president trang đầu phiêu linh
